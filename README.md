# Golf App

As a passonate golfer and coder I wanted to create an app that made it easy for me to track my rounds and analyze my shots. 
With this app you will be able to input your rounds along with many other valuable statistics such as greens in regulations, putts, and etc...
I hope this app allows me to see the weaknesses in my game and find ways to improve of those weaknesses.
